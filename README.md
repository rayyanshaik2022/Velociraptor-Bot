# Velociraptor-Bot
A discord bot for managing servers.

## Description
A multi-purpose discord bot to be used on a private server with my friends. 
This bot provides basic security for our server with an easily customizable verification system. 
Important e-learnig and virtual learning commands that can reply with my schoolâ€™s schedule and per class zoom links. 
The bot can also join voice channels and play different sound effects stored as .mp3 files.

## Primary Dependencies
- discord.py
  - The python library to access the discord api. This allows a user to access the "control system" for their discord bot, perform actions as a bot, and gather data as a bot. 
  - This project demonstrates a strong understanding of how to use this library, as well as follow the suggested abstraction procedures (use of COGS)
- json
  - This library allows a dictionary to be easily stored as a .json file, as well as read a .json file into a dictionary
  - This project utilizes this to keep some data persistant, such as server and user preferences, along with custom calender data.
  - Some issues I had to overcome when working with saving data was *when* to do so - opening, saving, and closing a file every 
  time a change was made proved to be extremely inefficient and sometimes led to the file corrupting. 
  I solved this by setting up a timed async loop that saves the data every 5 minutes.
  
## Features and implementations
- List Comprehension
  - Something I'm quite proud of in this project, is my use of list comprehension - this is a powerful shorthand to generate lists in python. 
  Overall, they can help to shorten/cleanup code and often times are more efficient
  - An example from this project:
    - `counter = [m for m in velo.members if m.status in [discord.Status.online, discord.Status.do_not_disturb] and m.name not in bots]`
